Advent of Code 2023
-------------------

**NOTE: SPOILERS FOR THE 2023 ADVENT OF CODE PUZZLES**

This is my attempt at doing some of the
[2023 Advent of Code challenges](https://adventofcode.com/events/2023).

My implementation is as a library crate, with common functions shared
between modules (i.e. reading puzzle inputs) and the puzzles themselves solved
by calling executables with either a custom input file or a predefined "goal".

Puzzle inputs are stored in [/inputs](./inputs) in plain text.

See [the website](https://adventofcode.com/events/2023) for details on the
puzzles themselves.
